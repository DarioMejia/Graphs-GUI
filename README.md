# Graphs GUI in Java
This Java Application was originally created as a assignment for the Data Structures II subject at my university, Universidad del Norte. It allows you to create and visualize a graph, as well as, perform different algorithms on it. The application's name is "Internet Services", due to the original assignment. If you want to see the application's UML, [click here](https://github.com/DarioMejia/Graphs-GUI/blob/main/Internet%20Services%20UML.pdf).
